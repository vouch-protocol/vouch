= Vouch Protocol Project Proposal

== Project Proposal for LF AI & Data Foundation

=== Name of Project
Vouch Protocol

=== Requested Project Maturity Level
**Sandbox**

(Seeking Sandbox entry with roadmap to Incubation within 12 months)

=== Project Description

**What it does:**
Vouch Protocol is the identity layer for AI agents. It provides cryptographic identity, authentication, and non-repudiation for autonomous AI systems using Ed25519 signatures, JWK key format, and W3C DID-compatible tokens.

**Why it is valuable:**
As AI agents increasingly make real-world decisions (financial transactions, healthcare access, customer service), there is no open standard for:

- **WHO** - Cryptographically proving agent identity
- **WHAT** - Signing the intent of each action
- **WHEN** - Timestamped, tamper-proof audit trail

Vouch Protocol fills this gap, providing "SSL certificates for AI agents."

**Origin and History:**

- Created by Ramprasad Gaddam in Dec, 2025
- Inspired by SSL/TLS trust model applied to AI agents
- Open-sourced under Apache 2.0 license
- Published to PyPI as `vouch-protocol`

**Ongoing Development:**

- Active development with regular releases
- 223 passing tests, 90%+ code coverage
- Framework integrations: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, MCP
- Enterprise features: key rotation, revocation, reputation scoring
- C2PA/CAI media provenance integration

=== Statement on Alignment with LF AI's Mission

Vouch Protocol directly aligns with LF AI & Data's mission of:

1. **Supporting open source AI/ML projects** - Apache 2.0 licensed, fully open
2. **Building trusted AI systems** - Cryptographic identity enables accountability
3. **Enterprise readiness** - Production features (KMS, Redis, key rotation)
4. **Interoperability** - Works with all major AI frameworks

As AI agents become more autonomous, trust and accountability become critical infrastructure. Vouch Protocol provides this foundation as an open standard.
