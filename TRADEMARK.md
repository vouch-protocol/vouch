## Trademark Registration Status

### Current Status: ™ (Common Law)

The Vouch Protocol trademarks are currently protected under common law (unregistered). We are pursuing formal registration.

### Registration Roadmap

| Phase | Jurisdiction | Status | Est. Cost |
|-------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. India | IP India (Class 9, 42) | Planned | ₹4,500 (~$55) |
| 2. International | Madrid Protocol | After India filing | $600-800/country |
| 3. US | USPTO | Via Madrid | Included above |
| 4. EU | EUIPO | Via Madrid | Included above |

### Why India First?

1. **Cost-effective**: ₹4,500 vs $350 (USPTO)
2. **Priority date**: Establishes global priority under Paris Convention
3. **Madrid Protocol**: India is a member; can extend to 100+ countries
4. **Home jurisdiction**: Project originators are India-based

### Classes Being Registered

- **Class 9**: Computer software for cryptographic identity verification
- **Class 42**: Software as a service (SaaS) for AI agent authentication

## Why This Policy Exists

We want Vouch Protocol to be freely usable by everyone. However, we need to ensure that:
1. Users can trust that "Vouch" means the official, secure implementation
2. Cloud providers cannot create confusion by offering "AWS Vouch" that may diverge from the standard
3. The community maintains a single, interoperable standard

This policy is modeled after the [Kubernetes Trademark Guidelines](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage) and [Docker Trademark Guidelines](https://www.docker.com/legal/trademark-guidelines).
